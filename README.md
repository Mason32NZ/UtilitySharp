# UtilitySharp
A jack of all trades and master of none. UtilitySharp provides helper classes for things such as strings, and numbers so you donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel.

What can it do you might ask?
* Clean dirty data strings and give it back to you in the requested type.
* Generate cryptographically random numbers.
* Find the nth index of a substing.
* Check if two numbers are equal 'enough'.
