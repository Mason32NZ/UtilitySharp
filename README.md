# UtilitySharp

A jack of all trades and master of none. UtilitySharp provides helper classes for things such as strings, and numbers so you donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel.
It currently only has UtilitySharp.StringHelper.CleanAndConvert() which cleans a string and returns the desired type.

UtilitySharp is on NuGet and can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UtilitySharp/).

## Installing

Type the following into the NuGet Package Manager:

```
Install-Package UtilitySharp
```

## Usage

Some examples of its usage.

### Basic

```
int n = UtilitySharp.StringHelper.CleanAndConvert<int>("My number is 5."); // Output: 5
```

### Regex & DateTime
